# AML-3304 Assignment 1

# 🧠 MentorMind AI – Your Intelligent Academic & Career Co-Pilot

## 🔍 Problem Analysis – What's Missing in the Market?

Despite the abundance of online courses, career guidance platforms, and productivity apps, several gaps persist:

1. **Fragmentation**  
   Students juggle multiple tools (e.g., Notion for planning, YouTube for tutorials, ChatGPT for Q&A, LinkedIn for networking, Coursera for learning), which aren’t synchronized.

2. **Lack of Personalization**  
   Platforms don't adapt deeply to individual goals, strengths, and weaknesses.

3. **Missing Long-Term Strategy**  
   No system helps build and track a long-term, evolving plan toward both academic excellence and career trajectory.

4. **Underdeveloped Self-Reflection**  
   Few platforms cultivate critical soft skills like reflective learning, time management, or interview prep.

5. **No Dynamic Feedback Loop**  
   Current tools don't learn from the user over time to adjust content, pace, and priorities dynamically.
